# DigitalPlat FreeDomain Open Source
This folder contains portions of the front-end and back-end code we’ve made open-source.

DigitalPlat is a nonprofit charitable organization that supports open-source and free software. While we fully embrace the principles of transparency and community collaboration, we’ve taken a cautious approach by not yet fully open-sourcing our back-end code. This decision is based on security considerations and the need to mitigate potential vulnerabilities and hacking risks.

However, we are committed to gradually open-sourcing more of our codebase over time. This will help us optimize the project and foster greater community involvement. The files in this folder represent the parts of the project that are currently open to the public.
