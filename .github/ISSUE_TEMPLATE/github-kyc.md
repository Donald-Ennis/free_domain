### KYC Using Your GitHub Account

Please make sure your GitHub account meets the following requirements (all are required):

- [ ] The issue title must be: Request GitHub KYC - Your US.KG Panel registered username. This ensures our automated script can detect your registered username. (For example, your title should be:  **Request GitHub KYC-example**)
- [ ] This is not a new GitHub account; it has existing repositories and stars.
- [ ] This is my first US.KG NIC Panel account.
- [ ] I promise not to use the domain name for criminal or abusive purposes. 
- [ ] It would be amazing if you could star our repository! (If you prefer not to, you can remove the star after approval. Keeping it starred PLEASE, however, will help more people discover FreeDomain and support our continued growth! Thanks!)

**Your Account Details (US.KG NIC Panel):**

Please fill out the following information; otherwise, your request will not be processed:

- Username: 
- Reason for Registering the .US.KG Domain Name (Why):
