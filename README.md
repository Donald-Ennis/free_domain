# DigitalPlat FreeDomain – **Your Free Domain Awaits!**

## 📢 Announcement 📢  December 25, 2024 6:40 (GMT+0)

We regret to inform you that due to an excessive number of scam pages detected and associated with *.US.KG domains, the .KG registry has set our domain registry status to "Inactive." As a result, all registered *.US.KG domains are temporarily unable to resolve and are currently inaccessible.

Please rest assured that we are actively communicating and collaborating with the .KG registry to resolve this issue as swiftly as possible. We are implementing enhanced measures to prevent similar incidents in the future and are working tirelessly to restore full service.

In the meantime, please do not worry. If this situation impacts your business, we strongly recommend taking the following actions:

Switch to Backup Domains: If you have a backup domain available, please transition to it as soon as possible.

Set DNS Manually: You can configure your computer's DNS settings to 142.171.123.133, which will allow you to continue using your *.US.KG domains without interruption.
We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your patience and understanding. Further updates will be provided as soon as we have new information.

Thank you for your continued support.
